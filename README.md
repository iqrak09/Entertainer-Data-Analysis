Hello everyone,

I am excited to share with you my project on Entertainer Data Analysis as part of my internship with Unified Mentor, I had the opportunity to work on this project and gain valuable insights into analyzing entertainer data.

In this project, I used  pandas, MS Excel, Tableau to analyze Entertainer data and created visualizations to better understand analysis of an entertainer's career.

I had a great time working on this project and gained as well as learned a lot in the process. I hope it inspires you to swoop into data analysis and explore the insights that can be gained from it.
